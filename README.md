# OpenShaper

Free, open-source surfboard CAD that runs entirely in your browser — a from-scratch
modern rebuild of the legacy Java/Swing [BoardCAD-LE](https://github.com/ciditup/boardcad).
Design outlines, rocker, and cross-sections; see live volume, area and weight; preview
the board in 3D; and export STL / DXF / PDF — all client-side, nothing to install, no account.

**▶ Live: https://openshaper.com** — the app opens at [openshaper.com/app](https://openshaper.com/app).

A passion project for the shaping community. Built and shared under the GPL, the same
license as the BoardCAD it descends from.

## Features

- Outline, rocker, and cross-section editors driven by one shared board model
- Live specs: length, width, thickness, volume, plan-shape area, center of mass, weight
- 3D preview (Three.js) with a striped-reflection shading mode for fairness checks
- Compare against a "ghost" board; printable spec sheet
- Export **STL** (3D print / CAM), **DXF** (2D outline), and **PDF**, plus a native
  `.board.json` save — every format free
- Reads legacy `.brd` files

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces + Turborepo + Vite (static SPA — no server, no database)
- React 18 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Zustand (board document + command/undo)
- Canvas 2D editors; Three.js / react-three-fiber 3D
- Pure, immutable, framework-agnostic geometry kernel pinned to golden reference data
- Tauri 2 optional desktop shell wrapping the same web app

## Site map

The static site is prerendered to real HTML at build time ([vite-react-ssg](https://github.com/Daydreamer-riri/vite-react-ssg)):

| Route                             | Page                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                               | Marketing landing                           |
| `/app`                            | The design app (editor; client-only island) |
| `/about`                          | About / the maker's story                   |
| `/surfboard-design-guide`         | Guide: outline, rocker, rails, volume       |
| `/surfboard-construction-methods` | Guide: PU, EPS, hollow wood & more          |

Each content route ships a unique `<title>`, meta description, canonical, Open Graph and
JSON-LD; `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are generated into `dist/` on build.

## Develop

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # run the web app (vite-react-ssg dev)
pnpm test         # all package tests (kernel golden tests, etc.)
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build        # prerendered static build to apps/web/dist
```

## Deploy (Cloudflare)

The site deploys to **Cloudflare** (Workers Builds, Git-connected) at the `openshaper.com`
apex domain. It's an **assets-only** deploy — the prerendered static build is published with
no server code. `wrangler.toml` declares the assets directory; `.node-version` pins Node.

- **Build command (dashboard):** `pnpm build`
- **Deploy command (dashboard):** `npx wrangler deploy`
- **Assets directory:** `apps/web/dist` (from `wrangler.toml` → `[assets] directory`)
- **Worker name:** must match `name` in `wrangler.toml` (`openshaper`)
- **Canonical/OG origin:** `VITE_SITE_URL` build env var (defaults to `https://openshaper.com`)

`_headers` (in `apps/web/public/`) is honored. The build's `base` is `/` for the root domain
and switches to `./` only under a Tauri build. A GitHub Pages workflow
(`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`) remains as an unused fallback.

### One-time setup (manual)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, set the project's **build command** to `pnpm build` (deploy
   command `npx wrangler deploy` is the default). Output dir + Node come from the repo.
2. Add `openshaper.com` as a **custom domain** on the Worker (Cloudflare manages DNS).
3. Optionally replace `apps/web/public/og-cover.svg` with a rasterized 1200×630 `og-cover.png`
   for maximum social-scraper compatibility (then update `OG_IMAGE` in `apps/web/src/seo/site.ts`).
