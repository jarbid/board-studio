            Hi — I&apos;m a technical designer by trade. My day job is taking concepts and bringing
            them from the digital world into real, physical things, so I spend a lot of my time
            living in that gap between a screen and a workshop. I&apos;m a maker and a tinkerer at
            heart: I&apos;m always pulled toward a new project, a new material, or a new bit of tech
            to play with.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other half of my life is the ocean. I surf, and somewhere along the way I fell hard
            for surfboard <em>design</em> — not just riding boards, but understanding why they ride
            the way they do. That curiosity turned into sawdust. I started designing and building my
            own <strong>hollow timber surfboards</strong>, and my daily driver right now is a{' '}
            <strong>5&apos;8&quot; fish I made from Paulownia</strong> — light, lively, and a
            constant reminder of how good it feels to ride something you built with your own hands.

            “There&apos;s nothing quite like paddling out on a board you drew, shaped and glassed
            yourself.”
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Why I built OpenShaper</h2>
          <p>
            I wanted a design tool that fit the way I actually work — quick to open, honest about
            the numbers (volume and weight matter a lot when you&apos;re building in timber), and
            able to export clean geometry for templates and CNC. Naturally, testing out some
            vibe-coding with a surfboard CAD turned into a genuinely fun project. It became the tool
            I now reach for in my own board-design workflow.
          </p>
          <p>
            OpenShaper is a from-scratch, modern rebuild in the spirit of the original open-source{' '}

              BoardCAD

            — rewritten to run entirely in your browser, with a live 3D preview and a clean export
            path. It stands on that project&apos;s shoulders, and like BoardCAD it&apos;s released
            under the GPL so it stays free and open.
          </p>
